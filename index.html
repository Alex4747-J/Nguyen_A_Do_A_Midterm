        <h3>Why Gryffindor is better in my own opinion</h3>
        <p>Gryffindor was mainly the house the movie centers around, other houses were mostly overshadowed in the main book, so we got most of our information, stories surrounding Gryffindor’s image.
            Moreover, even though Gryffindor can be proven to be wrong, mistaken with their choices, ultimately they reflect the most basic characteristic of human beings, knowing they’re in the wrong and choose to fix their problems.
            Their bravery is second to none, and that teaches a lot of youngsters about overcoming your own fears and own your rightful power. Gryffindor are always proving themselves and worrying what other people think. Sometimes this is good, and other times it can get in the way. For example, some of Ron’s first sentences are that he needs to prove himself against his brothers, glumly expressing that “so if I do something good, it’s no big deal,”.
        </p>
         <p>All in all, Gryffindor is the most powerful house in all of Hogwarts history</p>
