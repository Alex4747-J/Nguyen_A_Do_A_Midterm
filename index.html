      <h2>The Story about house Slytherin</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The house colours were silver and green, and a serpent emblem. The
          Slytherin common room was located in the castle's dungeons.
        </li>
        <li>
          House Slytherin founder was Salazar Slytherin, one of the most a
          talented wizard, and skilled in Parseltongue and Legilimency.
        </li>
        <li>The characteristics defined by cunning, pride and ambition.</li>
        <li>
          Alas, Salazar's anti-Muggle stance and belief that Hogwarts should be
          for pure-blooded students only gave the house a poor reputation.

      <h2>Advantages of house Slytherin</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Ambition and Resourcefulness: Slytherins are known for their strong
          ambition and resourcefulness, enabling them to set and achieve high
          goals through strategic planning and determination.
        </li>
        <li>
          Strategic Decision-Making: Unlike Gryffindors, who may act
          impulsively, Slytherins are more calculated, carefully evaluating
          potential outcomes before taking action, leading to more effective
          decisions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adaptability and Self-Preservation: Slytherins excel in assessing
          situations and adjusting their strategies to ensure favorable
          outcomes, showcasing flexibility and resilience in various
          circumstances.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Slytherins, of course, have quite a bit of “honor,” at least in their
        own opinions. They have a lot of pride. They also are conscious of how
        they are viewed, but in a rather “snobby” way. Instead of having a need
        to prove them, they want to look sophisticated; thus, they have “honor”
        in a more selfish way.

      <h2>Why is Slytherin a better house in my opinion</h2>
      <img
        src="images/Slytherinstudents.jpg"
        alt="slytherin students"
        style="width: 50%"
      />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Slytherine sets a high goal and doesn't stop until they achieve them.
          Their drive and resourcefulness make them natural leaders and
          innovators.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unlike 3 other houses, Slytherin uses their intelligence
          strategically. They think ahead, plan carefully and always stay a step
          ahead.
        </li>
        <li>
          In my opinion, although Slytherin is seen as cold, they are fiercely
          loyal to those they trust. Their inner circle, like their family, will
          do anything to protect their own.
        </li>
        <li>
          In wizarding world history, many influential wizards such as Severus
          Sanape, Merlin and even Voldemort, aka Tom Marvolo Riddle (though not
          exactly a role model) came from Slytherin. The house breeds power,
          leadership and lasting impacts.
