        <h3>Why Gryffindor is better in my own opinion</h3>
        <p>Gryffindor was mainly the house the movie centers around, other houses were mostly overshadowed in the main book, so we got most of our information, stories surrounding Gryffindor’s image.
            Moreover, even though Gryffindor can be proven to be wrong, mistaken with their choices, ultimately they reflect the most basic characteristic of human beings, knowing they’re in the wrong and choose to fix their problems.
            Their bravery is second to none, and that teaches a lot of youngsters about overcoming your own fears and own your rightful power. Gryffindor are always proving themselves and worrying what other people think. Sometimes this is good, and other times it can get in the way. For example, some of Ron’s first sentences are that he needs to prove himself against his brothers, glumly expressing that “so if I do something good, it’s no big deal,”.
        </p>
         <p>All in all, Gryffindor is the most powerful house in all of Hogwarts history</p>

      <h3>The Story about house Slytherin</h3>
      <img src="images/Slytherin.jpg" alt="slytherin logo" style="width: 30%" />
      <ul>
        <li>
          The house colours were silver and green, and a serpent emblem. The
          Slytherin common room was located in the castle's dungeons.
        </li>
        <li>
          House Slytherin founder was Salazar Slytherin, one of the most a
          talented wizard, and skilled in Parseltongue and Legilimency.
        </li>
        <li>The characteristics defined by cunning, pride and ambition.</li>
        <li>
          Alas, Salazar's anti-Muggle stance and belief that Hogwarts should be
          for pure-blooded students only gave the house a poor reputation.

      <h3>Advantages of house Slytherin</h3>
      <img

        alt="slytherin aesthetic"
        style="width: 40%"/>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ambition and Resourcefulness: Slytherins are known for their strong
          ambition and resourcefulness, enabling them to set and achieve high
          goals through strategic planning and determination.
        </li>
        <li>
          Strategic Decision-Making: Unlike Gryffindors, who may act
          impulsively, Slytherins are more calculated, carefully evaluating
          potential outcomes before taking action, leading to more effective
          decisions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adaptability and Self-Preservation: Slytherins excel in assessing
          situations and adjusting their strategies to ensure favorable
          outcomes, showcasing flexibility and resilience in various
          circumstances.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Slytherins, of course, have quite a bit of “honor,” at least in their
        own opinions. They have a lot of pride. They also are conscious of how
        they are viewed, but in a rather “snobby” way. Instead of having a need
        to prove them, they want to look sophisticated; thus, they have “honor”
        in a more selfish way.

      <h3>Why is Slytherin a better house in my opinion</h3>
      <img
        src="images/Slytherinstudents.jpg"
        alt="slytherin students"
        style="width: 50%"/>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Slytherine sets a high goal and doesn't stop until they achieve them.
          Their drive and resourcefulness make them natural leaders and
          innovators.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unlike 3 other houses, Slytherin uses their intelligence
          strategically. They think ahead, plan carefully and always stay a step
          ahead.
        </li>
        <li>
          In my opinion, although Slytherin is seen as cold, they are fiercely
          loyal to those they trust. Their inner circle, like their family, will
          do anything to protect their own.
        </li>
        <li>
          In wizarding world history, many influential wizards such as Severus
          Sanape, Merlin and even Voldemort, aka Tom Marvolo Riddle (though not
          exactly a role model) came from Slytherin. The house breeds power,
          leadership and lasting impacts.
